# ImageSegmentation
This report is a description of our
approach for the second mini-project in the Deep
Learning course given at EPFL, Lausanne. The project
aims to create a mini deep learning framework and
use it for a simple classification task with randomly
generated data.

# Testing the scripts
The provided script is run without argument. Plots
and execution time can be enabled by changing two
booleans at the beginning of the script. One will
enable plots similar to figures 2, 3, 4. The other will
compute and display the training time of the network.
